    "1. **Explain the purpose and advantages of NumPy in scientific computing and data analysis. How does it enhance Python's capabilities for numerical operations?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. The advantages of NumPy include:\n",
    "   - **Performance:** NumPy operations are implemented in C, making them faster than standard Python lists.\n",
    "   - **Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays consume less memory than Python lists.\n",
    "   - **Functionality:** It offers a wide range of mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra functions.\n",
    "   - **Integration:** It integrates well with other scientific libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib.\n",
    "   - **Convenience:** The syntax is concise and allows for vectorized operations, which can simplify code and improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare and contrast `np.mean()` and `np.average()` functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the other?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`np.mean()`:** This function calculates the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.\n",
    "   - **`np.average()`:** This function also calculates the weighted average along the specified axis if weights are provided; otherwise, it defaults to the arithmetic mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use `np.mean()` when you want a simple average without any weighting. Use `np.average()` when you need to account for different weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Describe the methods for reversing a NumPy array along different axes. Provide examples for 1D and 2D arrays.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **1D Array:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "     reversed_arr = arr[::-1]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **2D Array:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n",
    "     reversed_arr = arr[::-1, ::-1]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How can you determine the data type of elements in a NumPy array? Discuss the importance of data types in memory management and performance.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You can determine the data type of elements in a NumPy array using the `dtype` attribute.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   print(arr.dtype)  # Output: int64 (for example)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Data types are important because they:\n",
    "   - **Memory Management:** Determine how much memory is needed to store the array.\n",
    "   - **Performance:** Affect the speed of computations. Operations on smaller data types (e.g., int8) are generally faster than on larger ones (e.g., int64).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Define ndarrays in NumPy and explain their key features. How do they differ from standard Python lists?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `ndarray` (N-dimensional array) is the core data structure of NumPy. Key features include:\n",
    "   - **Homogeneous:** All elements in the array have the same data type.\n",
    "   - **Multi-dimensional:** Can be of any dimension (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Efficient Operations:** Supports efficient and vectorized operations.\n",
    "   - **Memory Layout:** Arrays are stored in contiguous memory blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Differences from Python lists:\n",
    "   - **Fixed Size:** ndarrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike lists which can grow dynamically.\n",
    "   - **Homogeneity:** All elements must be of the same type.\n",
    "   - **Performance:** NumPy arrays are generally faster and more memory-efficient for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Analyze the performance benefits of NumPy arrays over Python lists for large-scale numerical operations.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Vectorization:** NumPy allows for vectorized operations, which are faster than using loops in Python.\n",
    "   - **Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays use less memory due to their fixed data types and efficient memory storage.\n",
    "   - **Optimized Algorithms:** Many NumPy functions are implemented in C and optimized for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compare `vstack()` and `hstack()` functions in NumPy. Provide examples demonstrating their usage and output.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`vstack()`:** Stacks arrays in sequence vertically (row-wise).\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     a = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "     b = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "     np.vstack((a, b))\n",
    "     # Output: array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "     #                [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **`hstack()`:** Stacks arrays in sequence horizontally (column-wise).\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     a = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "     b = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "     np.hstack((a, b))\n",
    "     # Output: array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Explain the differences between `flipr()` and `flipud()` methods in NumPy, including their effects on various array dimensions.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`fliplr()`:** Flips the array left to right (horizontally).\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "     np.fliplr(arr)\n",
    "     # Output: array([[3, 2, 1],\n",
    "     #                [6, 5, 4]])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **`flipud()`:** Flips the array upside down (vertically).\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "     np.flipud(arr)\n",
    "     # Output: array([[4, 5, 6],\n",
    "     #                [1, 2, 3]])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Discuss the functionality of the `array_split()` method in NumPy. How does it handle uneven splits?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `array_split()` splits an array into multiple sub-arrays. It can handle uneven splits by creating sub-arrays of different sizes when the array does not divide evenly.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "   sub_arrays = np.array_split(arr, 3)\n",
    "   # Output: [array([1, 2]), array([3, 4]), array([5])]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Explain the concepts of vectorization and broadcasting in NumPy. How do they contribute to efficient array operations?**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Vectorization:** Refers to performing operations on entire arrays rather than using loops. This leverages low-level optimizations in NumPy and results in faster execution.\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "      result = arr * 2  # Vectorized operation\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - **Broadcasting:** Allows operations on arrays of different shapes. Smaller arrays are broadcast across larger ones to match dimensions.\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      a = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "      b = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])\n",
    "      result = a + b\n",
    "      # Output: array([[2, 3, 4],\n",
    "      #                [3, 4, 5],\n",
    "      #                [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "      ```"
